# AStarPathfinding
Uses A* search algorithm to solve mazes. Download and run the jar file from AStarPathfinding\\dist. Upload an image of a maze by dragging and dropping the image file onto the GUI. If necessary, adjust the contrast of the image with the program to increase the disparity between walls and paths. Click on the start and end point on the image and watch the optimum path be created
